The framework has been applied to conduct GWAS of age-related macular degeneration on a dataset of over 25,000 individuals.

To protect patient confidentiality, identifiers (such as a patient's NHS number) are pseudonymised through tokenisation. For additional security, the tokenisation differs between different NHS domains. To link data about a patient held in two domains requires first removing the tokenisation, which would expose personal information. To avoid this, a partially homomorphic encryption scheme is used which enables data to be linked without revealing the underlying raw identifiers."},{"uniqueId":4,"who":"Google","sector":"Health and Social Care","description":"A publicly available resource of statistics and visualisations intended to show the changes in the populationâ€™s mobility habits in response to COVID-19 interventions, based on location data from Google users opted in to location history tracking.
